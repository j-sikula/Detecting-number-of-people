# Scenarios for measurement
1. people exits/ enter 2x on the center of doors
- 2 m distance
- 1 m distance 
- 0.5 m distance
- next to the other

2. from right corner to left corner
- 2 m distance
- 1 m distance 
- 0.5 m distance
- next to the other

3. right side of the door
- 2 m distance
- 1 m distance 10:45:00 3times to the door 
- 0.5 m distance  10:46:00

4. left side of the door
- 2 m distance
- 1 m distance 
- 0.5 m distance  10:48:50 end

5. closing the door 10:50:50

6. when opening door from indoor - immediately exit room without colsing door 10:51:44

7. enter and close door,  6., 7. twice 10:54:30

8. open exit close 10:55

9. open enter and slowly closing the door 
10. repaeating 8. 9. with closing door

4. exiting/entring when door are not opened entirely twice

# Blink Example

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

This example demonstrates how to blink a LED by using the GPIO driver or using the [led_strip](https://components.espressif.com/component/espressif/led_strip) library if the LED is addressable e.g. [WS2812](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812B.pdf). The `led_strip` library is installed via [component manager](main/idf_component.yml).

## How to Use Example

Before project configuration and build, be sure to set the correct chip target using `idf.py set-target <chip_name>`.

### Hardware Required

* A development board with normal LED or addressable LED on-board (e.g., ESP32-S3-DevKitC, ESP32-C6-DevKitC etc.)
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming

See [Development Boards](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits) for more information about it.

### Configure the Project

Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`).

In the `Example Configuration` menu:

* Select the LED type in the `Blink LED type` option.
  * Use `GPIO` for regular LED
  * Use `LED strip` for addressable LED
* If the LED type is `LED strip`, select the backend peripheral
  * `RMT` is only available for ESP targets with RMT peripheral supported
  * `SPI` is available for all ESP targets
* Set the GPIO number used for the signal in the `Blink GPIO number` option.
* Set the blinking period in the `Blink period in ms` option.

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

As you run the example, you will see the LED blinking, according to the previously defined period. For the addressable LED, you can also change the LED color by setting the `led_strip_set_pixel(led_strip, 0, 16, 16, 16);` (LED Strip, Pixel Number, Red, Green, Blue) with values from 0 to 255 in the [source file](main/blink_example_main.c).

I (2325) example: Turning the LED OFF!

I (6325) example: Turning the LED OFF!
I (7325) example: Turning the LED ON!
I (8325) example: Turning the LED OFF!
```

Note: The color order could be different according to the LED model.

The pixel number indicates the pixel position in the LED strip. For a single LED, use 0.

## Troubleshooting

* If the LED isn't blinking, check the GPIO or the LED type selection in the `Example Configuration` menu.
